                            p Working in the newspaper industry early on drilled in the importance of the 5 W‚Äôs for writing a story but it‚Äôs a great foundation for project building too. It‚Äôs really difficult to design solutions and discuss trade-offs if you don‚Äôt know the context of the why, who, where or when. It‚Äôs also hard to know if it actually worked unless you answer the how.

                    p Forms were pointing users to legacy pages after submitting.

                    h6 System - API CONFIG
                    p API calls from custom client software were pulling from legacy areas of the system.

                    h6 Human - Actual Usage
                    p Most jumps from real users happened around content items which can be accessed by the following users:

                        li Marketers

                    h4 Problem 2: What are users doing to the content item
                    p I found which users were hitting the old system but we stalled here for a bit because actions on the content item don‚Äôt necessarily go to individual trackable pages and we‚Äôd need to push missing tracking hooks to get a better look at what users were actually doing with the content item in the old system vs the new system. We could solve part of the problem now though with a few suggested solutions.

                    h4 Solution Prioritization
                    p Fixing the bad configurations and enabling hooks would get us closer to the cutoff threshold and were high-impact, low effort. Forms in DAM and Marketing Operations apps could be pointed away from legacy pages and we could have customer service reach out to high-volume system administrators individually to fix their API settings. We could implement both of the system-level solutions while we waited for more user hooks.

                    p Content items are used throughout all of Aprimo's enterprise level applications so even the smallest change has the potential to break consistency and functionality across the entire platform of apps. Additionally content items are represented across different levels of fidelity inside different features.

                    h3 Building consistency across fidelity.
                    p The trick to getting any object to feel similar across various levels of fidelity is to keep the order of properies and provide similar styling callbacks. To compare all the instances of content items I audited the visibility and order of attributes using Object Maps.

                    h3 Object Maps
                    p Mapping out the information architecture for core objects with OOUX inside AirTable allowed me to track variations of how a content item appears across the platform and between features. It's a methodical way to uncover decades of inconsistency and flag missing expected functionality that is critical to making things feel intuitive. Mapping objects this way also provides a chance to consolidate code and point out opportunities for reusable components.

                    h3 Preventing Future Chaos
                    p By tracking parents or children of ojects in OOUX I also knew which related objects would also need consideration if any functionality changed. For example what should happen to a user-created content item in the system if the user who created it is removed? Should it get removed as well or just display a missing token where the source link is normally?

                    h3 Tracking Complex Decisions
                    p Tracking objects in AirTable allowed me tag object properties with release data so I could dynamically filter on what's really necessary. I also attached questions that needed to be sent to various groups or flagged for validation.
